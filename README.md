This Github repository contains graphics and animation code samples based on ReactJS, SVG, and GSAPI. There are many swatch-like (read: very similar) code samples, and feel free to modify them to incorporate other features of GSAP, which is a very impressive JavaScript library.

Please keep in mind that these code samples are not intended to present any 'best practices' nor are they production-quality code: they're just for fun, and artistic enhancements are welcome:)
